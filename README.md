# CRUD---Product---Breakdown-Management
This is an exploratory fullstack web development project using technologies like the React Framework for the Frontend, SpringBoot for Backened and MySQL Database

The idea is to maintain a product inventory, consisting of basic information like no of breakdowns, product cost and product name. All the other details can be added in future work.
